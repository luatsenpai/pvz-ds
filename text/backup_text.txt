Evening, {PLAYER_NAME}.
Those zombies just<lf>won't let up, will they?
You'll notice that fighting zombies at night is different than<lf>in the day.
For one, you won't get<lf>any sun falling from<lf>the sky.
You can still get sun<lf>from sunflowers,<lf>though.
And lucky for you, you<lf>got yourself some<lf>puff-shrooms.
Plant as many of those as you can and you'll be A-O-GOOD.
Hey, you found my car key!

Thank you for feeding me! Keep giving me food and I'll give you valuable information!
Chompers and wall-nuts work exceedingly well together. It's no surprise, considering they were roommates in college.
If you ever listen to<lf>anything I say,<lf>listen to this:<lf>you want two columns<lf>of sunflowers.<lf>I'm dead serious here.
Snorkel zombies. I hate 'em. How do I deal? Wall-nuts on lily pads, that's how.
If you enter some button commands like say LB RB LT RT during a game, I'll bet you'd be able to do some cool stuff.
How many cherry bombs<lf>does it take to take<lf>down a Gargantuar?<lf>Here's a hint: more than<lf>one, fewer than three.<lf>Here's a more explicit<lf>hint: Two.
If you're looking for mushroom plants for your Zen Garden, you'll have better luck playing on levels where it's nighttime.
I wouldn't worry about permanently damaging your lawn with doom-shrooms. In time the earth heals itself.
Pssst! Enter that secret code and try typing 'future' while playing to experience zombies... from the FUTURE!
Legend has it that frozen zombies eat slower. I'm here to tell that legend has its facts straight.
Have you heard of the<lf>elusive Yeti Zombie?<lf>Some say he likes hiding<lf>where it's pitch black.
What's cheaper than free? Nothing! That's why puff-shrooms are essential on all night levels! 
Are you hoping to find water plants for your Zen Garden? I bet my phloem you'll have the most luck searching in pool levels.
Have you noticed that<lf>Gargantuars sometimes<lf>use OTHER ZOMBIES to<lf>bash your plants?<lf>Whatever works, I guess.
Stinky the Snail sure<lf>loves his chocolate.<lf>Maybe loves it a little too<lf>much, you know? He<lf>won't sit still for an hour<lf>after he's had some.
If you think playing survival<lf>'endless' mode only drops<lf>pool-style plants for your<lf>Zen Garden, think again!<lf>It drops everything-style.
Often the question<lf>is asked: where do you find<lf>chocolate? A better<lf>question would be:<lf>where DON'T you find<lf>chocolate? It drops in<lf>every game mode!
Grave Busters, eh? Pick 'em only when you can see graves on the right side of the screen along with the zombies. That's what I do.
I've heard that Buckethead zombies take five times as many hits as regular ones.
I hear that entering that code and putting in 'mustache' brings about a terrifying transformation in the undead!
Do multiple Snow-peas in a row slow zombies down more than just one? The sad but truthful answer is 'Nay.'
You know that zombies<lf>emerge from gravestones,<lf>right? So what's stopping<lf>you from using grave<lf>busters to get rid of them<lf>in Survival night?<lf>Is it pride?
If you're looking for the<lf>inside info on how long a<lf>level's going to be,<lf>count the flags on the<lf>level meter. That'll set<lf>you up real nice.
Roof cleaners.<lf>Classic items. Can't<lf>recommend them highly<lf>enough. Best thing about<lf>them? They give you<lf>a shot at beating Pogo Party.
If you're wondering if feeding a hypno-shroom to a dancer zombie compels him to summon backup dancers for you, bet it all on 'Yes.'
Make Money Fast! By Playing Survival Endless! Then E-mail Me Your Bank Account Number!
You'd think torchwoods<lf>would douse snow peas.<lf>And you'd be correct,<lf>because you, my friend,<lf>are one smart cookie.
Those hateful ZomBotany zombies! Who do they think they are, shooting at your plants? It's a good thing wall-nuts stop 'em cold.
The Pogo Party and Bobsled<lf>Bonanza mini-games are<lf>really, really, really<lf>difficult. Wanna drop<lf>one of the 'reallys'<lf>off that description?<lf>Use the squash.
Just when you thought jalapenos couldn't be any more useful, a Tree of Wisdom lets you know that they also destroy the Zomboni's ice trails! BAM!
Once you buy the imitater, try selecting the little drawing in the upper left corner of your Almanac to access the entry on that sucker.
The number of coins you receive in Wall-nut Bowling is proportional to how cool you are as measured by how many ricochets per nut you can pull off.
Please do not tap on the glass! Or actually, go ahead; Press <Y> on your Aquarium Garden or during Zombiquarium to deafen your underwater creatures.
When I was just an acorn<lf>my grampa told me,<lf>'Son, Vasebreaker puzzles<lf>are much easier if you<lf>break the vases on the<lf>right side first.' 
Dancers in I, Zombie may<lf>seem expensive, but in the<lf>right situation they're<lf>worth every penny.
I had a dream. In it, cattail<lf>spikes popped balloons and<lf>dropped zombies to the<lf>ground. I don't know<lf>what it means.
Growing aquatic plants in your Zen Garden is pretty much impossible without the Aquarium Garden. Just saying.
Digger zombies violate the<lf>natural order with their<lf>subterranean ways.<lf>It's only fair to use<lf>magnet-shrooms to<lf>steal their mining picks.
Every day brings<lf>new challenges and<lf>opportunities. Oh,<lf>and new marigolds in<lf>Crazy Dave's shop.
Mushroom Garden! Huh! What is it good for? Absolutely nothin'! Except growing mushrooms, that is.
Tired? Depressed? Ladders on tall-nuts getting you down? A quick magnet-shroom will whisk your cares away!
The tallness of tall-nuts earns widespread acclaim due to their effectiveness vs. Dolphin Riders and Pogo Zombies.
The explosive force of a cherry bomb or jalapeno is more than capable of dislodging a ladder from a Wall-nut.
It's tempting to feed<lf>all your chocolate to<lf>Stinky the Snail.<lf>He's such a chocolate hog.<lf>But remember:<lf>Zen Garden plants<lf>like chocolate too!
Torchwood fire is hotter than rage, but Zombonis, screen doors, ladders and catapults can take the heat.
If you rely on upgrade plants in Survival: Endless, be acutely aware that they get more expensive the more you have on your lawn.
The Imps in I, Zombie seem<lf>weak. But they're speedy<lf>and great for fetching<lf>that last brain when<lf>you've cleared the rest<lf>of the opposition.
If you enter 'trickedout,' don't be surprised if you see something wacky happen to your lawnmowers. Donâ€™t forget to press LB RB LT RT first.  You forgot didnâ€™t you?
Thank you for feeding me!<lf>I'm out of new wisdom<lf>for now, but I might have<lf>more if you grow<lf>me tall enough!
Mmmm, I could sure use<lf>some yummy fertilizer!
I think I've seen<lf>that cloud before.
Don't mind me. I'll just be over here, growing.
I'm metabolizing like crazy!
I'll never get why you<lf>animals spend all day<lf>moving around like<lf>you do.
I experience time<lf>at a vastly slower<lf>rate than you!
I think I'm perennial!
My xylem is tingling!
You can get a lot of wisdom just by standing around.
So I've heard about this "winter" dealie. Can't say I'm looking forward to it.
Mmmm... sunlight is DELICIOUS!
Oops, sorry...<lf>I just gave off<lf>some oxygen.
Gosh, I can grow leaves!
I feel a spurt coming on! 
At this stage I lack<lf>worldly knowledge!
I really appreciate all the cash you're spending on fertilizer!
That cloud looks just like a vast aggregation of water droplets!
Have you met my cousin Yggdrasil? Very big in Sweden. Lots of fans.
I'm taking sociology at an online college. I'm really learning a lot.
After careful observation<lf>I've deduced that it is the<lf>Earth that revolves around<lf>the sun and not<lf>the reverse as it appears.
When you've been around as long as I have, you sleep less and hallucinate more.
If you're mistaking the forest for the trees, just remember: A forest is a collection of individual trees and not the other way around.
History repeats itself<lf>but it always gets<lf>the details wrong.
If the past, present <lf>and future all <lf>simultaneously exist <lf>as "block time",<lf>surely the experience<lf>of "now" can only be<lf>an elaborate illusion?
Courage is easy; dedication costs extra.
Here's some wisdom that bears repeating...
Tree food, please!
Hey, I'm 100 feet tall! Celebrate with me by inputting 'daisies' to get the zombies to leave tiny daisies behind when they die.  
Whoa! I'm 500 feet tall! This calls for some dancing!  Type 'dance' after entering the code to get the zombies to boogie on down! 
WOW! I'm 1000 feet tall! Celebrate with me by typing 'pinata' to make zombies spit out candy when destroyed!
Thank you for feeding me! I've given you all my wisdom, but you can still grow me taller!

There's a zombie on your lawn
There's a zombie on your lawn
There's a zombie on your lawn
We don't want zombies on the lawn
I know your type: tall, dark, and dead
You want to bite all the petals off of my head
And then eat the brains of
the one who planted me here
I'm just a sunflower but see
me power an entire infantry
You like the taste of brains
we don't like zombies
"I used to play football"
"Road cones protect my head"
"I have a screen-door shield"
"We are the undead!"
There's a zombie on your lawn
There's a zombie on your lawn
There's a zombie on your lawn
We don't want zombies on the lawn
Maybe it's time to reevaluate
I know you have a lot of food on your plate
Brains are quite rich in cholesterol
You're dead so it doesn't matter,
Instead we'll use this solar power
to make a lawn defense at any hour
"I like your tricycle"
"There's butter on my head"
"I'm gonna eat your brains!"
"We are the undead!"
There's a zombie on your lawn
There's a zombie on your lawn
There's a zombie on your lawn
We don't want zombies on the lawn
